# Echoes in Red

There‚Äôs nothing more unsettling than waking up in the same room, again and again, each time with blood on your hands and no memory of how it got there. Echoes in Red is a looping psychological thriller that forces you to question not just who you can trust, but whether you can even trust yourself.

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è
When you launch the game, you will see a **disclaimer screen right at the start**.  

It warns you about:  
- **Blood, psychological horror, and disturbing imagery**.  
- **Unreliable narrators and gaslighting galore**.  
- Basically: if you came for wholesome romance, you are **very lost**.

##  Developer Notes
This project started as *‚Äúa small thriller VN‚Äù* and spiralled into:  
- Tracking who kills you.  
- Counting how many times you trust suspicious people.  
- Writing increasingly sassy death screens.
